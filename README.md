# Neural-Network-in-Numpy

This project demonstrates how to build a neural network for **multiclass classification** using only **NumPy**, without relying on high-level libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.

The goal is to provide a minimal, fully transparent implementation to understand the inner workings of neural networks from scratch.

---

#### Features

- Built entirely with **NumPy**
- Designed for **multiclass classification tasks**
- Educational focus: understand forward propagation, backpropagation, and training dynamics

---

#### Future improvements

- The repository will be **better organized** and **more thoroughly documented**.
- Some of the text is currently written in **Italian** â€” it will be fully **translated into English** in future updates.
