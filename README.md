# Neural-Network-in-Numpy
The project demonstrate how to build a neural network model for multiclass classification tasks using only Numpy, 
whitout relying on high level libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. 
The repository currently contains all the code written so far. It will be better organized and documented in future.

There's also text in italian and it will be transated in future
